## Hi, I’m thePlant 🌱

Just Kidding, I’m not actually a plant.  
I’m a human who loves sunlight, growth, and taking things slow, so I go by **thePlant**.

## Why *theSisyphean*?

I often use the alias **theSisyphean** because, from a stranger’s perspective, I seem to do a lot of *meaningless* things.

Camus’ Sisyphus isn’t tragic.
He knows his task has no final meaning, no payoff
and he continues anyway.

The meaning isn’t in reaching the top.
It’s in choosing the climb, fully aware of its pointlessness.
Whether it contributes anything doesn’t matter.
There’s no obligation for this to be useful, efficient, or impressive.
What matters is that the struggle is conscious.

That it’s chosen.
That it’s *mine*.

> *“The struggle itself is enough to fill a man’s heart.
> One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”*
 
So yeah, the name stuck.  
(I also thank a friend for introducing me to this quote.)

## What is this website?

This site is a collection of thoughts, experiments, projects, and things I felt like doing,
not because they’re useful, but because they felt worth doing.

You may or may not gain anything from it.  
But if something resonates, that’s more than enough.
