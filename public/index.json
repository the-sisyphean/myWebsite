He knows his task has no final meaning, no payoff and he continues anyway.\nThe meaning isn’t in reaching the top. It’s in choosing the climb, fully aware of its pointlessness. Whether it contributes anything doesn’t matter. There’s no obligation for this to be useful, efficient, or impressive. What matters is that the struggle is conscious.\nThat it’s chosen. That it’s mine.\n“The struggle itself is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”\nSo yeah, the name stuck.\n(I also thank a friend for introducing me to this quote.)\nWhat is this website?\r#\rThis site is a collection of thoughts, experiments, projects, and things I felt like doing, not because they’re useful, but because they felt worth doing.\nYou may or may not gain anything from it.\nBut if something resonates, that’s more than enough.\n","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/anime/one-piece/","section":"","summary":"","title":"One Piece","type":"anime"},{"content":"","date":"24 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/books/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"books"},{"content":"","date":"24 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/books/monk-wshf/","section":"","summary":"","title":"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari","type":"books"},{"content":"this is for what i learn in code\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/code/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"code"},{"content":"this is for design.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/design/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"design"},{"content":"this id for various projects and case competition, i shall take part in.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"projects"},{"content":"this is for random thoughts\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thoughts/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"thoughts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
